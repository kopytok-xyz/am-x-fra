We use reasonable information security measures, including physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, including firewalls, antivirus and SSL encryption in order to protect Your Personal Data from: unauthorized access; improper use or disclosure; unauthorized modification or alteration; unlawful destruction or accidental loss.</p>
<p>These measures vary based on the sensitivity of Personal Data that We collect, process, and store and the current state of technology.</p>
<h3>Parties receiving Your data from Us also secure it</h3>
<p>Our partners, employees, contractors, and other third parties are obliged to keep Your Personal Data confidential when accessing it. Anyone who has such access is subject to strict contractual obligations regarding confidentiality and may be subject to disciplinary action if it does not fulfill these obligations. Also, We take care to ensure that parties, which receive Your Personal data from Us (regardless of where they are located at), have sufficient safeguards in place to properly process and protect Your Personal Data in line with Our own data protection and information security standards.</p>
<h3>We do Our best to prevent data leakage</h3>

In case such a breach occurs, We undertake to notify You and the regulators about the incident as quickly as possible, as well as to make every effort to minimize negative consequences.</p>
<h2>WHERE WE STORE YOUR DATA & TO WHERE WE TRANSFER IT</h2>
<h3>Your data may be stored and processed worldwide</h3>
<p>Personal Data We collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in the Policy in any country in which We operate. Besides, Your Personal Data may be transferred, stored, and processed by recipients in various countries around the world where Our servers are located, and Our databases are operated. We do all necessary to make sure all recipients understand the necessity to process Personal Data only on a legal basis considering any and all applicable legislation.</p>
<h3>Our servers' location</h3>
<p>Our servers are located in Dubai, the UAE, at Our legal address specified above.</p>
<h3>To whom We may transfer Your data</h3>
<p>We do not sell Your Personal Data. We also do not allow any Personal Data to be used by third parties for their own marketing purposes, except in cases where You explicitly request or provide consent for Us to do so. However, We do need to share Personal Data to provide smooth Website operation to You. Below are the different scenarios under which We may share Your data with third parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>any third party to whom We assign or novate any of Our rights or obligations under a relevant agreement;</li>
<li>any national or international regulatory, enforcement, exchange body, central or local government department, and other statutory or public bodies or court where We are required to do so by applicable law or regulation at their request;</li>
<li>any third parties, if You expressed Your consent to such transfer or transfer of Your Personal Data;</li>
<li>third parties mentioned in clause 4.8. of the Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens if We're going to transfer Your data overseas?</h3>
<p>One of the important steps We take when it comes to international data transfers involving third parties is due diligence and vetting.</p>
<p>As part of the third-party vetting process, We ensure that Personal Data will only be transferred to a third party located outside the place of Our servers with the required cross-border transfer mechanism and safeguards in place as specified below. We consistently monitor changes to the international transfer mechanisms permitted under applicable privacy laws to ensure ongoing compliance with international data protection standards.</p>
<p>When We engage a third party that is located outside the place of Our servers, We agree on the appropriate level of data protection, including additional contractual, technical, and organizational measures and the execution of a transfer impact assessment where necessary, to ensure the ongoing protection of the rights and freedoms of all individuals concerned by Our processing.</p>
<p>We only transfer Your Personal Data to those third parties where We can be sure that We can protect Your privacy and Your rights, for example, the third party is located in a country that the EU (as a lead jurisdiction in privacy regulation matters) has deemed to have adequate data protection laws in place or to a country which has not been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of Personal Data protection but where We have a contract in place with that third party which includes the European Commission's standard data protection clauses.</p>
<p>Whenever We are sending data to countries that are not providing the same level of protection as European laws, i.e. to countries that have not been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection, We are going to use appropriate safeguards to protect Your Personal Data, including Standard Contractual Clauses for Processors for data transfers to processors, along with additional technical and organizational measures to ensure an equivalent level of protection.</p>
<h3>You consent to transfer Your data to countries with non-adequate protection</h3>
<p>By using the Website, You authorize the transfer of Your Personal Data to countries that have not been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of Personal Data protection, where Our service providers process data for customer care, account management, and service provisioning, and to other locations where We and/or Our service providers operate, and to its (and their) storage and use as specified in the Policy and any applicable EULA or other agreement between You and Us.</p>
